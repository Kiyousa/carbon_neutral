# the constants of this problem

y = 42
"y stands for the number of years till the target year"

# T = 85.9e2 * 12.0 / 44.0 * 2.0 * 1 / 3 * 0.8
T = 85.9e2 * 12.0 / 44.0 * 2.0
"T stands for the target for carbon sequestration by forest ecosystem, unit: million tonnes"
"The 2.0 stands for the conversion factor which is supposed to be 0.5 showed up in the left of the constrain"

r = 0.04
"r stands for the interest rate"

alpha = 0.6
"alpha stands for the weight of the present value of afforestation costs to the confidence in policy consistency"
beta = 1.0 - alpha
